# My first project

## About

- ⚡ Project realized in the Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp at [Digital House](https://www.digitalhouse.com/). 
- ⚡ [Mercado Libre] UI Recreation (https://mercadolibre.com/).
- ⚡ Its main objective was to practice static layout with HTML5 and CSS3 styling on the client side, and Express and NodeJS on the server side. 

### But wait a minute! I'm want to go the extra mile here, so in the future you'll see...

- ⚡ Solid MVC architecture.
- ⚡ From static to JS-dynamic-webapp.
- ⚡ Cleaner CSS-styling. 
- ⚡ EJS template engine running partial views to optimize. 
- ⚡ CRUD with NodeJS, MySQL and Sequelize.
